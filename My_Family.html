		<p>Families are an integral part of one’s life. It does not matter if you have a small or big family, as long as you have one. A family serves as the first school 
           to the child where one learns about various things. The basic knowledge about one’s culture and identity comes from their family only. In other words, you are a
             reflection of your family. All the good habits and manners one has incorporated are from their family only. I feel very lucky to be born in a family which 
               has made me a better person. In my opinion, families are an essential part of one’s being. In this essay on my family, I will tell you why family is important.</p>
